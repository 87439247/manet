# Manet

> There is only one true thing: instantly paint what you see. When you've got it, you've got it. When you haven't, you begin again. All the rest is humbug.

Manet is a REST API server which allows to capture screenshots of websites using various parameters. It is a good way to make sure that your websites are responsive or to make thumbnails.

Manet uses [SlimerJS](http://slimerjs.org) under the hood, which is very similar to [PhantomJs](http://phantomjs.org), except that it runs on top of [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko) (the browser engine of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org)) and [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey) (the JavaScript engine of Firefox). This is a conscious choice to be more stable and predictable.

*Project was named in honor of Ã‰douard Manet, French painter (1832-1883). He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.*


## Main features
* Ready-To-Use
* Configurable CLI application
* Flexible REST API
* File caching
* Various image formats
* Sandbox UI


## Setup

### Preset
First install SlimerJS:

* You can download it from the [official site](http://slimerjs.org/download.html) and install manually.
* or you can use the power of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):
```bash
npm install -g slimerjs
```

Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, cannot render web content without a graphical window, but you can launch SlimerJS with xvfb if you are under linux or MacOSx, to have a headless SlimerJS, so it is also necessary to install [Xvfb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) (X virtual framebuffer) for *nix or OS X systems.

For example, you can use **apt-get** to install **xvfb** on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install xvfb
```

### Installation

After preliminaries operations you can install Manet using NPM:
```bash
npm install -g manet
```

That is all, now you can start and use Manet server. As you can see, it is unnecessary to clone Git repository or something else.


## Server launching

Server launching is a simple as possible:
```bash
manet
```

If everything is OK, you should see the following message:
```
info: Manet server started on port 8891
```

## Server configuration

Manet server uses hierarchical configurations to cover differnet usage use-cases:

* Command-line parameters
* Environment variables
* Built-in configuration JSON file *("config/default.json")*

Each configuration level could be overridden by another level.
The most-priority parameters are command-line parameters.
The less-priority parameters are stored in build-in configuration file.


### CLI parameters

TODO


### Configuration file

Built-in configuration could be found in `manet` directory. For example, on Ubuntu it is located here: *"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/manet/"*.

Default configuration file *("default.json")*:

```json
{
    "command": {
        "linux": "xvfb-run -a slimerjs",
        "freebsd": "xvfb-run -a slimerjs",
        "sunos": "xvfb-run -a slimerjs",
        "darwin": "slimerjs",
        "win32": "slimerjs.bat"
    },
    "port": 8891
}
```


## REST API

REST API is available on "/" by direct GET request with `"url"` query parameter.

TODO


### Query examples

Just some query examples that could be executed by any REST API client (ex: `curl`):

```
# Take a screenshot of the github.com.
GET /?url=github.com

# Custom viewport size. Return a 800x600 PNG screenshot of the github.com homepage.
GET /?url=github.com&width=800&height=600

# Disable JavaScript. Return a screenshot with no JavaScript executed.
GET /?url=github.com&js=false

# Custom User Agent.
GET /?url=github.com&agent=Mozilla%2F5.0+(X11%3B+Linux+x86_64)+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+(KHTML%2C+like+Gecko)+Chrome%2F34.0.1847.132+Safari%2F537.36

# HTTP Basic Authentication. Return a screenshot of a website requiring basic authentication.
GET /?url=mysite.com&user=john&password=smith

# Screenshot delay. Return a screenshot of the github.com homepage 1 second after it's loaded.
GET /?url=github.com&delay=1000
```


## Sandbox UI

Sandbox UI is available on "/" by direct GET request without `"url"` query parameter.
