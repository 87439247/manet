> There is only one true thing: instantly paint what you see. When you've got it, you've got it. When you haven't, you begin again. All the rest is humbug.

Manet is a service with REST API to capture screenshots of websites using various parameters. It is a good way to make sure your websites are responsive or to make thumbnails.

Manet uses SlimerJS under the hood, which is very similar to PhantomJs, except that it runs on top of [Gecko](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko), the browser engine of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org).
This is a conscious choice to be more stable.
